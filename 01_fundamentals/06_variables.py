'''There are some rules to name a variable in python:

1. A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2. A Python variable name cannot start with a number.
3. A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
4. Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
5. The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.'''
